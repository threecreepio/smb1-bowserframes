# SMB1 Bowser frames

Code to create the bowser frames listing at https://3.creep.io/smb/bowserframes

To create the backing data, use FCEUX and run generate-data/screenshots.lua and generate-data/valid-frames.lua on the pellsson rom. This will take quite a while..

When running in local development the site expects all screenshots to be hosted on http://localhost:8000.
